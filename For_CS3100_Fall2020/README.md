* Begin watching the video in Overview_Of_CS3100_Fall2020/
  by running the Jove notebook there. 

* This is a directory prepared for the CS 3100, Fall 2020 students

* It contains a description of how various Jove modules will be
  covered in our lectures
  
* I'll now straight present the syllabus and the schedule of
  lectures. 
  
  - All Quizzes will be assigned on Canvas 
  
    - They are given out before a PAIR of lectures (occurring in a week)
    
    - They must be solved and submitted before those PAIR of lectures
    
  - All our Assignments will be provided via Jove notebooks
  
  - All our Exams (MT-1, MT-2 and Finals) will be given on Canvas

* CS 3100 is running in a *FLIPPED CLASS* style!

* You MUST run each Jove notebook mentioned below *BEFORE* you come
  to a lecture. These notebooks contain a video recording PLUS practice
  material for you
  
* Some notebooks will last across multiple lectures, and some lectures
  will involve multiple notebooks
  
* Assignments are to be turned in as finished Jove notebooks.

* Each question of an assignment will be in a separate ".ipynb" Jove file.

* In some cases, we will allow documents to be scanned and uploaded as PDF. We require
  you to be using Adobe Scan - a free app you can get for iPhone or Android.

* For more info, see the PDF documents on Canvas that describe our course policies.

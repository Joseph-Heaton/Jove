* Week-1 **Reading**: Chapters 1, 2, 3. __Outcomes:__
  Emerge with complete understanding of the basics of
  computability, why studying formal language matters, and know how to construct
  languages using set operations, concatenation, and exponentiation. They also
  begin studying Kleene-star. As for practical matters, they understand the course
  objectives, how to run the course software and submit the required material for
  grades.

   - 1:8/22
     - Run the Notebooks within 01_Computability_Languages/ 
     - Quiz-1 covers L1,2
     - Asg-1  covers L1,2
   - 2:8/24
     - Run the Notebooks within 01_Computability_Languages/
   
* Week-2 **Reading**: Chapters 3, 4 (except 4.6 thru 4.8), 5, 6. __Outcomes:__
  Finish understanding Kleene-star, and are able to design
  DFA using two methods: By knowing how to encode salient information in DFA states
  (by naming DFA states to retain this info) and by Boolean operations on DFA (union,
  intersection, complement). They know how to document DFA using literate-programming
  methods of annotating comments within a simple DFA markdown. They are able to
  automatically build, and test DFA, following important principles of software testing.

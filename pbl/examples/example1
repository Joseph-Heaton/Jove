#Very simple example to show off syntax

#First declare the variables and specify variable orderings
Var_Order : x1 x2 x3

#You can have multiple Var_Order statements, just don't
#duplicate variables. The variables declared in the first
#Var_Order statement will come before later declared variables.
#You can even declare variables after sub-formulas
Var_Order : x4

#Create a sub-formula. Note: These variables do not have
#Have to be declared. They are just place holders
#You can force precedence with parenthesis.
sub = ~x1 & x2 & (x3 | x4)

#Constants are just 0's and 1's.
sub_True = 1

#The main expression is the only one considered by the BDD
#and is declared like so
Main_Exp : sub <=> sub_True

#A slightly harder Lewis Carroll puzzle. 
#Please see first puzzle for better comments.
#
#The puzzle is:
#Assume:
#
# All, who neither dance on tight ropes nor eat penny-buns,
#         are old.
#
# Pigs that are liable to giddiness are treated with respect.
#
# A wise balloonist takes an umbrella with him.
#
# No one ought to lunch in public who looks ridiculous
#        and eats penny- buns.
#
# Young creatures who go up in balloons are
#        liable to giddiness.
#
# Fat creatures who look ridiculous may lunch in public if
#        they do not dance on tight-ropes.
#
# No wise creatures dance on tight-ropes if they are
#        liable to giddiness.
#
# A pig looks ridiculous carrying an umbrella.
#
# All, who do not dance on tight-ropes and who are treated
#        with respect, are fat. 

#Show that:
#
# Wise young pigs do not go up in balloons


#Declare all the variables. Notice how you can use
#more than one line.
Var_Order : eatPennyBuns old young danceTightRopes
Var_Order : pigs respect giddy publicLunch ridiculous
Var_Order : umbrella fat wise balloon 

#These are the Premises
P1 = (~danceTightRopes & ~eatPennyBuns) => old 
P2 = (pigs & giddy) => respect
P3 = (ridiculous & eatPennyBuns) => ~publicLunch
P4 = (young & balloon) => giddy
P5 = (wise & balloon) => umbrella
P6 = (fat & ridiculous & ~danceTightRopes) => publicLunch
P7 = (wise & giddy) => ~danceTightRopes
P8 = (pigs & umbrella) => ridiculous
P9 = (~danceTightRopes & respect) => fat  

#This is the what we're trying to show
C = (wise & young & pigs) => ~balloon

#This is all the premises conjoined
P_All = P1 & P2 & P3 & P4 & P5 & P6 & P7 & P8 & P9

#The main expression.
#ACK! There are satisfying assignments!
#There's an error in the input
#Can you find it? (hint look at the pdf and look at
#the satifying assignments, do they make sense?)
Main_Exp : P_All & ~C
